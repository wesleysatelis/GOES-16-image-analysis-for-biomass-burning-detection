# GOES 16 image analysis for biomass burning detection

This is the source code used for image processing and analysis of NOAA's meteorological satellite GOES-16, used during my undergrad project at the University of Campinas/SP.

The main goal here is to characterise and quantify Ã¡reas where pre-harvesting burning of sugarcane is still in use, the project was fundend by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.
