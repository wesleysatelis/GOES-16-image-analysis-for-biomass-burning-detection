This is the source code used for image processing and analysis of NOAA's meteorological satellite GOES-16, used during my undergrad project at the University of Campinas/SP.

The main main goal is to characterise and quantify areas where pre-harvesting burning of sugarcane is still in use. 

This project was fundend by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and developed at the Center for Meteorological and Climate Research Applied to Agriculture (CEPAGRI/UNICAMP).
